# HATEOAS game

The first (_as to my knowing_) truly HATEOAS game!

This is a game, which you may start as a Spring Boot project, and play  
it in your browser or in a REST client of choice.  
This isn't a RESTful game in Roy Fielding's terminology,  
at least for the reason the server keeps state of a particular  
game (i.e. player's position, goal's position, size of the gaming board).  
Nevertheless, **it is 100% HATEOAS**, at least.
